                                                       Well said!Some people think that foot ball is just a game where you roll the ball over the pitch. Wrongly taken!
                                                       It is a game where the coach applies his philosopy on the players so that they deliver it well.It is like a teacher-student situation.
                                                       The players also use their brain to deliver their coache's philosopy.Their legs are just tools.It is a game where players play with passion to entertain their fans. <br>
